          <ul>
            <li>hearing, seeing or sensing things that are not there,</li>
            <li>suspiciousness, mistaken beliefs,</li>
            <li>incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional flatness.</li>
         </ul>
          <p>People with this condition may also feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense.</p>
          <p>ABILIFY is also used to treat adults and adolescent patients (13-17 years of age) who suffer from manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder. Bipolar disorder is a condition with symptoms such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>feeling invincible or an all powerful inflated self-esteem</li>
            <li>racing thoughts, easily losing train of thought</li>
            <li>overreaction to what is seen or heard</li>

            <li>poor judgment</li>
            <li>sometimes exhibiting severe irritability</li>
         </ul>
          <p>ABILIFY is also used to treat symptoms of depression in adults when administered with your current antidepressant medicine. It is prescribed when you do not respond adequately to an antidepressant alone and after you have tried different antidepressant treatments during your current depressive episode.</p>
          <p>Depression is a condition with symptoms such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>feeling sad,</li>

         </ul>
          <p>It is important to discuss your depressive symptoms and possible side effects of ABILIFY with your doctor.</p>
          <p>ABILIFY is not a cure for your condition, but it can help manage your symptoms and in adult patients may reduce the risk of relapse.</p>

	<summary class="background-accent">What It Does</summary>
	
          <p>
            <strong>ABILIFY belongs to a group of medicines called atypical antipsychotic drugs.</strong>
         </p>
          <p>Antipsychotic medications affect the chemicals that allow communication between nerve cells (neurotransmitters). Illnesses that affect the brain may be due to certain chemicals in the brain being out of balance. These imbalances may cause some of the symptoms you may be experiencing. Doctors and scientists are not sure what causes these imbalances to occur. Exactly how ABILIFY works is unknown. However, it seems to adjust the balance of chemicals called dopamine and serotonin.</p>

        <p>The maximum dose should not exceed 30 mg once a day</p>
        <h3>Depression</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Usual adult dose:</strong> The usual starting dose is 2 -5 mg once a day administered with the antidepressant you are already taking. Depending on how well you respond and tolerate the initial dose, your doctor may prescribe a lower or higher dose, to a maximum of 15 mg once a day.</p>
        <p>Try to take ABILIFY at the same time each day. It does not matter whether you take it with or without food. Always take the tablet with water and swallow it whole.</p>
        <p>If you have the impression that the effect of ABILIFY is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
        <p>Even if you feel better, do not change or discontinue the daily dose of ABILIFY without first consulting your doctor. Although ABILIFY cannot cure your condition, it can help relieve your symptoms. If your symptoms improve or disappear, it is probably because your treatment is working. ABILIFY should be taken for as long as you and your doctor believe it is helping you.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Do not</strong> give ABILIFY to anyone else. Your doctor has prescribed it for you and your condition.</p>
        <p>ABILIFY is not for use in children under 13 years of age for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder, or for use in children under the age of 15 years for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p>
        <h3>Overdose</h3>
        <div class="well">If you have taken more ABILIFY tablets than your doctor has prescribed (or if someone else has taken some of your ABILIFY tablets), contact your regional Poison Control Centre and talk to your doctor right away or go to your nearest hospital emergency department. Take the medication package with you.</div>
        <h3>Missed Dose</h3>
        <p>If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember but <strong>do not take two doses in one day.</strong>

    <summary class="background-accent">Side Effects And What To Do About Them</summary>
	
        <p>Like other medicines, ABILIFY can cause some side effects. These side effects are most likely to be minor and temporary. However, some may be serious and need medical attention.</p>
        <p>Certain side effects occur more frequently in adolescent compared to adult patients, including abnormal movements, drowsiness and weight gain.</p>
        <p>The most common side effects of ABILIFY are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>feeling of restlessness (akathisia)</li>
            <li>drowsiness</li>
            <li>shaking (tremors)</li>
            <li>abnormal movements</li>
            <li>nausea, vomiting, upset stomach</li>
            <li>dizziness</li>
            <li>constipation</li>
            <li>headaches</li>
            <li>insomnia</li>
            <li>anxiety</li>
         </ul>
        <p>The following other side effects may also happen in some people who take ABILIFY:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>weight gain</li>
            <li>increase in the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood (hyperglycemia). Symptoms of high blood sugar can include feeling very thirsty and/or hungry, needing to urinate more than usual, feeling weak or tired, feeling sick to your stomach, feeling confused, fruity smelling breath.</li>
            <li>decrease in the amount of white blood cells.</li>
            <li>difficulty swallowing, which may lead to aspiration and choking.</li>
            <li>decreased blood pressure. Symptoms of decreased blood pressure can include lightheadedness or fainting when rising too quickly from a sitting or lying position.</li>
         </ul>
        <p>Because some people experience sleepiness, you should avoid driving a car or operating machinery until you know how ABILIFY affects you.</p>
        <p>Your doctor should check your body weight before starting ABILIFY and continue to monitor it for as long as you are being treated.</p>
        <p>Your doctor should take blood tests before starting ABILIFY. These tests will monitor blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides and the number of infection fighting white blood cells. Your doctor should continue to monitor your blood for as long as you are being treated.</p>
        <p>You should tell your doctor if you notice any symptoms that worry you, even if you think the problems are not connected with the medicine or are not listed here.</p>
